_____Missionary Cannibal Problem______
Programming Assignment for Problem 2:  
1.	Use the implementations of the search strategies available in the aima code; e.g. https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java to write the program that will search for the solution to Missionaries and Cannibals Problem. (10 points)   
2.	Provide the path to the solution generated by your code, indicating each state it has visited when using: (a) uniform-cost search; (b) iterative deepening search; (c) greedy best-first search; (d) A* search and (e) recursive best-first search (1 point/strategy).   
Describe clearly how you have implemented each state in the search space. (5 points) TOTAL: 10 points  
Extra-credit: List the content of the frontier and the list of explored nodes for the first 5 steps of each of the strategies used in 2.  (2 points/step/strategy)   
TOTAL: 50 points ONLY if it is possible to comprehend (1) the current node; (2) the content of the frontier; (3) the content of the list of explored/expanded nodes; (4) the children of the current node for each step.  


______Map of Dallas Problem________
Programming assignment PROBLEM 3: Searching for Road Trips in the U.S.A. (30 points) Considering the following table:  
Table of direct/flight distances to Dallas (in miles).  
___________________  
Austin          182  
Charlotte       929  
San Francisco  1230  
Los Angeles    1100

1) You contemplate to search for a trip back to Dallas from Seattle, having access to a road map which should be implemented as a graph. Use the aima code to find the solution and return a simulation of the RBFS strategy by generating automatically the following five values: (1) f_limit; (2) best; (3) alternative; (4) current-city; and (5) next-city for each node visited. (10 points)   
2) Compute the following five values: (1) f_limit; (2) best; (3) alternative; (4) current-city; and (5) next-city for each node visited. Specify at each step the current node and the next node. (5 points)  
  
  
The road graph is (in miles):  _____________________________________  
Los Angeles --- San Francisco ::: 383  
Los Angeles --- Austin        ::: 1377  
Los Angeles --- Bakersville   ::: 153  
San Francisco --- Bakersville  ::: 283  
San Francisco --- Seattle  ::: 807  
Seattle  --- Santa Fe  ::: 1463  Seattle --- Chicago  :::  2064  
Bakersville -- Santa Fe ::: 864  
Austin --- Dallas ::: 195  
Santa Fe --- Dallas ::: 640  
Boston --- Austin  ::: 1963  
Dallas --- New York  ::: 1548  
Austin --- Charlotte  ::: 1200  
Charlotte -- New York ::: 634  
New York --- Boston ::: 225  
Boston --- Chicago ::: 983  
Chicago -- Santa Fe ::: 1272 Boston 
--- San Francisco ::: 3095  

Extra-credit: Write a program that will check if the heuristic provided in this problem is consistent, given the road graph.
